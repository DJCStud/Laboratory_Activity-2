Explain the overall design of your program and justify why you chose this particular class structure and set of user-defined methods.

Describe how user input is handled in your program and discuss the role of exception handling (try–except) in preventing incorrect or unexpected behavior.

Identify one limitation of your current implementation and explain how it could be improved using additional OOP concepts or better error handling.

1.The program is a Student Enrollment System using OOP concepts. The main class of the program is StudentEnrollement, which is used to store the values and functions for the management of enrollment, tuition and cash balance of the students. By grouping up all the operations into a single class. It improves the program's readability, and reusability.

Class contains the user-defined attributes:
-cash(Student's balance)
-downpayment_paid(To check if the student has paid the downpayment)
-units(The number of enrolled units that the student has)
-cost_per_unit(The cost of tuition per unit)

Class contains the user-defined methods:
-enroll() for paying downpayment and units.
-view_tuition() displays tuition
-deposit() depositing money into the student's balance
-show_balance() displays the student's balance

2. The program accepts user input through menu choices and numeric entries. Exception handling is implemented using try–except blocks to prevent crashes from invalid inputs such as letters instead of numbers. Exception handling ensures the program continues running even when the user makes mistakes.

For example:
- Entering invalid units triggers a ValueError
- Entering a negative deposit is rejected
- Invalid starting cash is handled safely

3. One limitation of the current implementation is that it supports only one student. A possible improvement would be using additional OOP concepts such as multiple Student objects stored in a list, file saving using persistence This would allow managing multiple students and storing records permanently.
