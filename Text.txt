1.The program is a Student Enrollment System using OOP concepts. The main class of the program is StudentEnrollement, which is used to store the values and functions for the management of enrollment, tuition and cash balance of the students. By grouping up all the operations into a single class. It improves the program's readability, and reusability.

Class contains the user-defined attributes:
-cash(Student's balance)
-downpayment_paid(To check if the student has paid the downpayment)
-units(The number of enrolled units that the student has)
-cost_per_unit(The cost of tuition per unit)

Class contains the user-defined methods:
-enroll() for paying downpayment and units.
-view_tuition() displays tuition
-deposit() depositing money into the student's balance
-show_balance() displays the student's balance

PROGRAM DESIGN EXPLANATION

The program is a Student Enrollment System designed using Object-Oriented Programming.
The main class is StudentEnrollment, which represents a student managing tuition and cash.

The class contains attributes such as:
- cash (student's available money)
- downpayment_paid (status of enrollment requirement)
- units (number of enrolled units)
- cost_per_unit (tuition per unit)

The class includes several user-defined methods:
- enroll() handles downpayment and unit enrollment
- view_tuition() calculates and displays tuition
- deposit() adds money to the student's balance
- show_balance() displays remaining cash

This class structure was chosen because it groups all student-related operations into a single object. It improves organization, readability, and reusability.

USER INPUT AND EXCEPTION HANDLING

The program accepts user input through menu choices and numeric entries.
Exception handling is implemented using try–except blocks to prevent crashes from invalid inputs such as letters instead of numbers.

For example:
- Entering invalid units triggers a ValueError
- Entering a negative deposit is rejected
- Invalid starting cash is handled safely

Exception handling ensures the program continues running even when the user makes mistakes.

LIMITATION AND POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENT

One limitation of the current implementation is that it supports only one student.
A possible improvement would be using additional OOP concepts such as:
- multiple Student objects stored in a list
- a separate Admin or EnrollmentManager class
- file saving using persistence

This would allow managing multiple students and storing records permanently.
